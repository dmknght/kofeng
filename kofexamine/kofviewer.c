 * kofviewer - the engine's view of a file, navigable.
 *
 *   kofviewer [--db <dir>] [--sources <dir>] <file>
 *
 * kofexamine prints everything at once and is right to: piped into grep or
 * diffed against yesterday, a dump is the useful shape. This is the other half
 * of the same job - the same facts, but reachable one at a time, because writing
 * a signature is not reading a report. It is looking at a region, at some bytes
 * inside it, and at what the database already says about them, and moving
 * between the three until the marker is obvious.
 *
 * Both front ends stand on kofinspect, so neither owns a parser and the two
 * cannot drift about what an object is.
 *
 *
 * WHY NO CURSES
 *
 * The panes here are three rectangles of text with a cursor line in one of
 * them. Curses solves problems this does not have - overlapping windows,
 * terminals whose escape sequences are unknown, output that must be diffed
 * against the previous frame because the link is slow - and costs a dependency
 * in a tree whose modules are built -nostdlib and whose platform layer carries
 * its own memmem rather than assume one. A full repaint of a 24 line screen is
 * two kilobytes; there is nothing to optimise and so nothing for a library to
 * do.
 *
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO YET
 *
 * Recovered objects are not in the tree. The engine produces them through a scan
 * and the tree here is built from one parse, so putting them in means holding a
 * scan's output as a tree - which is the next thing, not a missing thing.
 * Selection, and turning a selection into a declaration, likewise.
